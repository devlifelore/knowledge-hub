The content is for educational purposes and only represents my personal skillset and technologies used. You might focus on other technologies but can still use this Roadmap to cover general concepts.  Due to the fast-paced nature of the tech industry, some information may become outdated. I strive to keep the information current. Always cross-reference with the latest sources.
